I have added the following:
3 firewalls, one for each server and one for the load balancer
The firewalls add a layer of security by only allowing authorized packets into
or out of the servers and the load balancer

1 SSL certificate
The SSL certificate enables www.foobar.com to use HTTPS. This encrypts all the
traffic between users and the backend.

3 monitoring clients, one for each serer and one to monitor all the traffic
comming in through the load balancer

A monitoring client can be placed infront of the database to monitor the queries
per second being made.

Issues
1. Terminating SSL at the load balancer raises these issues:
- The communication between the load balancer and the servers is unencrypted
- Increased load on the load balancer
- Difficulties with monitoring becauses the client's ip addres may not be preserved

2. Having one MySQL server for accepting writes can cause loss of performance
because the server acts as a bottle neck. To mitigate this several database
instances can be configured to accept writes.

3. This infrastructure design has all the same components, this problematic because:
- These components are a SPOF, if one fails it takes out the entire server cluster
- If one component is slower than the others this may cause the server resources
to be under utilized
