Explanation

1. When a user types www.foobar.com in their browser the DNS server that their browser
is configured to send a request to is tasked with resolving the domain name. The DNS
server looks up the IP address of www.foobar.com in its cache, or requests from another
DNS server if it does not have the address.

2. The DNS server responds with the IP address of www.foobar.com in this case 8.8.8.8

3. The user's browser then sends a request to 8.8.8.8

4. If the server can fulfill the user's request with a static page the web server
(Nginx) sends a response to the user.
If not the application server dynamically generates the response as laid out
by the business logic residing in the codebase and the data in the database.

5. The protocol that enables the communication between the user's device and
the server is HTTP

6. The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a CNAME record.


Issues with the above infrastructure

1. Single Point of Failure
There is only one server to handle the incoming traffic. This means the web
site www.foobar.com is unavailable due to planned or unplanned down time.

2. The layout is not scallable if the site receives more traffic than the
server can handle.
