In this design I added 1 server and a Load balancer to control the web traffic.

The web server has:
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 set of code files
1 database instance

The Load balancer uses the Round Robin algorithm because the two servers are
similar in resorces and this is a good algorithm to ensure that both servers
are utilized uniformly.
This set up is Active-Active because both servers are being used  simultaneously
as opposed to the Active-Passive set up where one server handles the load while
the other one is on stand-by.

In one server the database instance is the master, this is where any changes to
the database are writen and then replicated in the replica instance. This server
is the master node while the server with the replica database instance is the
replica node.

Issues
The Load balancer is a single point of failure.
The infrastructure is using HTTP and there are no firewalls so it is quite insecure
There is also no monitoring
